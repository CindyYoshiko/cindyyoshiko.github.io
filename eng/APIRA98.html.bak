<H3>INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</H3><BR>
<P>Corporate Bankruptcies in 1997 recorded 16,365 cases, over 12.5% from 1996's 
figure of 14,544 and amount of debts was the highest in history, 14.21 trillion 
yen in Japan. After the burst of the bubble economy in 1990, the Japanese 
economy has been on a downward slide and many companies have been faced with 
financial difficulties. Hence, a certain prediction model to assess the 
financial distress of Japanese firms is required. This paper presents some 
empirical results of a study regarding predictors of Japanese corporate failure 
as evidenced by the event of bankruptcy.</P>
<P>A few empirical studies of corporate bankruptcy in Japan have been 
undertaken. However, the results of these studies are not generalizable due to 
the limited size of their samples. In contrast, this study proposes a 
generalizable bankruptcy prediction model based on observations of 686 firms 
which went bankrupt, and 300 non-bankrupt firms which were extracted from 
107,034 non-bankrupt firms by systematic sampling method. </P>
<P>This study is comprised of two stages. First, I attempted to obtain a set of 
the financial ratios to best predict Japanese corporate bankruptcy using data 
mining technique without any initial hypothesis. After the variables (financial 
ratios) selection, I hypothesized that (1) the linear Multivariate Discriminant 
Analysis (MDA, for short) model is suitable and useful for Japanese corporate 
bankruptcy prediction while a quadratic model and other non-parametric model are 
not, and (2) a model using certain ratios must be a universal model independent 
of industry or company size.</P><BR>
<H3>QUESTIONS REGARDING PREVIOUS STUDIES</H3><BR>
<P>There have been a fair number of previous studies addressing the prediction 
of bankruptcy in the USA: well-known published contributions are Beaver [1966], 
Beaver[1968], Altman [1968], Meyer &amp; Pifer [1970], Deakin[1972], Edmister 
[1972], Altman &amp; McGough [1974] and Altman, Haldeman, and Narayanan [1977]. 
Some other notable contributions developing probabilistic prediction models are 
Martin [1977], Ohlson [1980], Zavgren [1985] and Lau [1987]. In Japan, there are 
also a few notable studies: Takahashi, Kurokawa &amp; Watase [1979], Toda[1984] 
and Gotoh[1989]. </P>
<P>I pose some questions to the previous studies both from a statistical point 
of view and from an accounting point of view. </P><BR>
<H4>Statistical issues</H4><BR>
<OL>
  <P>
  <LI>In previous studies, the method used to select variables is not clear. It 
  is difficult to obtain the best set of variables at one try using statistical 
  methods. However, previous studies never mentioned how to reduce or select the 
  final set of variables from the initial variable set. 
  <P></P>
  <P></P>
  <LI>It has not been proven whether paired sampling is advantageous or not. All 
  researches using linear MDA typically use the paired sampling method matching 
  bankrupt and non-bankrupt firms according to criteria such as industry and 
  size. However, the criteria were made by researchers' arbitrary decision. 
  Sample selection biases might also occur. Hence, in this study, samples of 
  bankrupt and non-bankrupt firms are not matched at all
  <P></P>
  <P></P>
  <LI>In the previous studies, the sample of bankrupt firms were small, e.g. 20 
  firms to 150 firms. It is difficult to clarify the financial characteristics 
  of bankrupt firms with such a small sample. In contrast, this study uses a 
  large number of bankrupt firms which failed in Japan during the period between 
  1986 to 1996, and thus develops a more generalizable model.
  <P></P></LI></OL><BR>
<H4>Accounting issues</H4><BR>
<P>Each previous study mentions the list of all variables but does not clearly 
mention the detail computation steps to obtain the variables. Income Statement 
shows a summary of revenue and expenses of a business entity for a specific 
period of time, such as a year. On the other hand, Balance Sheet shows a list of 
the assets, liabilities and owner's equity of a business entity as of a specific 
date, usually at the close of the last day of a fiscal year. Hence, the 
statements can not be compared or computed directly. To compute the financial 
ratios using Balance Sheet accounts, it is necessary to use averages during the 
period to obtain accurate ratios. There are no previous studies mentioning this 
point. </P><BR>
<H3>METHODOLOGY</H3><BR>
<H4>Variable selection</H4><BR>
<P>Several previous studies had used a brute empirical approach of initially 
choosing variables followed by Stepwise procedure to select the variables in the 
final discriminant function. However, these studies are limited in their ability 
to provide generalaizable results as to what financial variables can 
consistently predict financial distress. Therefore, in this study, the following 
systematic statistical approach is taken to select the best set of variables for 
predicting bankruptcy.</P><BR>
<P>(1) Data Mining Approach</P>
<DIR>
<P>Data mining was used to select the best set of the variables. The most 
popular and powerful data mining tool is Classification And Regression Tree 
model (CART model for short) which is now available with S-Plus or SAS program. 
The purpose of a classification study can be to produce either an accurate 
classifier or to uncover the structure of bankruptcy. This study aims for the 
latter, and tries to get an understanding of what variables or interactions of 
variables cause bankruptcy.</P>
<P>CART model selects the variables accurately without any requirements of 
statistical assumption, therefore, all collected data can be used. In this 
study, when CART model was used to selects the variables, the variables were 
also selected by Stepwise procedure to compare the results. Stepwise procedure 
requires the statistical assumption that the variables are normally distributed. 
To satisfy this hypothesis, data were trimmed off in groups of 20 from each end 
of the ordered data.</P>
<P>The reason two different techniques were used to select the variables was to 
confirm the accuracy of variable selection through comparison of the results of 
the two techniques. </P><BR></DIR>
<P>(2) Original financial ratios</P>
<DIR>
<P>The original sixty-one financial ratios are listed in appendix A with certain 
relevant statistics. The ratios were chosen on the basis of (1) popularity in 
literature, (2) usage by the Japan Development Bank, (3) usage by Teikoku Data 
Bank of its Cosmos 1 credit database, and (4) the author's initiated hypothesis. 
The variables can be classified into the following categories (1) popularity in 
the literature (X1-X8), (2) growth (X9-X12), (3) capital efficiency (X13-X16), 
(4) profitability (X17-X24), (5) activity (X25-X38), (6) productivity (X39-X43), 
(7) liquidity (X44-X53) and (8) coverage and other earnings relative to leverage 
measures (X49-X61). </P></DIR><BR>
<H4>Sample design</H4><BR>
<P>The samples include all bankrupt firms obtained from Teikoku Data Bank 
Cosmos1 Database. The data set for this study is 686 bankrupt firms and 300 
non-bankrupt firms. The 300 non-bankrupt firms were extracted from 107,034 
non-bankrupt firms by systematic sampling method. All the bankrupt firms had 
failed between 1986 to 1996 in Japan. Although almost all the firms in the 
sample were unlisted companies, the average size of their assets were 3,757 
million yen (bankrupt firms) and 3,847 million yen (non-bankrupt firms). As an 
exception, financial service companies (bank, insurance and securities firms) 
and construction companies were excluded. Companies in these industries are 
structurally different and have a different bankruptcy environment. In 
particular, according to Japanese Accounting Principles, construction companies 
can choose to define the value of their total sales either on a basis of percent 
completion or on a basis of completed construction. This makes it difficult to 
compare operational performances with companies in other industries. </P>
<P>In this study, the definition of failure is purely legalistic, however, the 
sample also includes cases of composition undertaken without courtroom 
procedures.</P><BR>
<H3>EMPIRICAL STUDY IN JAPAN</H3><BR>
<H4>The first stage of reducing variables</H4><BR>
<P>The result of the first stage of variable reduction was that almost half of 
the variables chosen by the CART model and Stepwise procedure were the same. 
However the ratios indicating the strongest discriminant power were different 
for each procedure. CART model gave X2 (Retained earnings to total assets) as 
the strongest predictor, and Stepwise procedure gave X50 (Equity to Liabilities 
and shareholders) as the strongest predictor. I attempted to compare the 
characteristics of these two variables to understand why each procedure chose 
different variables as the most powerful predictor. First, the correlation 
matrices between the two variables were examined. Table I presents the result of 
correlation tests for both variables.</P><BR>
<P>Take in Table I</P><BR>
<P>The tests confirm that both X2 and X50 have strong positive correlation and 
that the two procedures selected accurate variables because they have almost the 
same characteristics from a statistical point of view. However, from an 
accounting point of view, they have the different characteristics. If a company 
increases its capital during the period and retained earnings is unchanged, X2 
decreases while X50 increases. Here, I investigated how many bankrupt firms 
increased their capital during the period previous to bankruptcy. It was found 
that 17.4% of the bankrupt firms, one hundred firms, increased their capital in 
the period previous to bankruptcy. Companies tried to increase their capital not 
only when facing financial distress but also during their growth stage. Hence, 
taking the conservative position to predict bankruptcy, I omitted X50 (Equity to 
Liabilities and shareholders) as this variable can potentially mislead the 
information user. Here, X2 and other 42 variables which were selected by one of 
the two procedures were retained.</P><BR>
<H4>The second stage of reducing variables</H4><BR>
<P>In the second stage, among the top seven variables chosen by both procedures 
six were the same. From a statistical point of view, it is certain that these 
six variables are strong indicators of bankruptcy. These variables were X2, X10, 
X24, X36, X39 and X53. However, it is believed that two of these, X39 (Sales Per 
one Employee) and X53 (Fix assets to Long-term capital) are not suitable 
variables as a predictor of bankruptcy. The statistical significance does not 
always follow accounting logic. I strongly point out here that it is dangerous 
to select the variables using only statistical logic.</P>
<P>The reason why X39 and X53 are not suitable variables as predictors of 
bankruptcy, even though they appear to strongly discriminate between bankrupt 
and non-bankrupt firms, is explained as follows: It is widely believed that 
ratio of Sales per one Employee should be higher and ratio of Fixed Assets to 
Long-term capital should be lower when a firm is financially healthy. However, 
for all practical purposes, the ratios for the bankrupt sample indicated a 
better condition than those for the non-bankrupt sample. The reason for this is 
that firms facing financial distress tried to reduce organizational redundancy 
or sell fixed assets to improve cash flow. Companies facing financial distress 
and companies in health financial condition, both indicated better ratios for 
these variables. The drawback of statistical analysis is that it can lead to 
incorrect conclusion. Therefore, I omitted these kinds of variables from the 
variable set carefully following accounting logic.</P>
<P>There were also another 15 variables commonly selected by both techniques. 
Therefore, a total of 19 variables were retained for the final reduction 
stage.</P><BR>
<H4>Final stage of reducing variables</H4><BR>
<P>The results of the final stage of variable's reduction by both procedures are 
illustrated in Table II.</P><BR>
<P>Take in Table II</P><BR>
<P>As shown in the table, the first four variables chosen by both procedures are 
the same and exhibit strong discriminant power at the second stage. As the 
variables could not be reduced further by analytical techniques, the final set 
of variables was selected at this stage. Hence, I chose the first four 
variables, X2, X24, X36 and X10, for the discriminant function. I tried to add 
other variables, however, I could not significantly improve upon the results by 
adding or changing the set of variables.</P>
<P>As the result of both procedures was almost the same, I could confirm that 
the selected variable set is reliable and consistent from both statistical and 
accounting view points.</P><BR>
<H3>EVALUATION OF SELECTED VARIABLES</H3><BR>
<H4>Independency of each variable</H4><BR>
<P>The correlation among the selected variables was evaluated, as it is probable 
that some of the financial ratios have a high degree of correlation. If some 
variables are highly correlated, they have the same influence on the financial 
position of the firm. Bankruptcy is caused by many different factors. Therefore, 
it is desirable to assess a firm from many different positions. Shirata [1996] 
pointed out that the set of variables used by Altman model [1968] could be 
classified into two groups by principal coordinates analysis. This means that 
the five variables chosen in his study have two different characteristics and 
can assess firms from two different positions. If the set of four variables 
chosen in this study do not have a high degree of correlation, they have 
different characteristics and can assess firms from four different positions. 
Table III &amp; Table IV present the results of the correlation analysis on the 
four variables chosen in this study. The upper line shows the correlation 
coefficient by Pearson and Spearman methods, and bottom line shows the 
significance probability for the null hypothesis that the value of correlation 
coefficient equals zero.</P><BR>
<P>Take in Table III</P><BR>
<P>Take in Table IV</P><BR>
<P>The results of this examination prove that the characteristics of these four 
variables are independent because they are uncorrelated. This also proves that 
the selected variables in this study can assess firms from four different 
positions.</P><BR>
<H4>Evaluation of discriminant power</H4><BR>
<P>The discriminant power of the set of variables which were selected in this 
study and the set of variables which were used in previous studies [Altman 1967] 
and Toda [1985] were compared. Both previous models consisted of five variables. 
One of the five variables, Market value equity per value of debt, used in both 
previous studies could not be used with the sample of this study. Therefore, the 
discriminant power of four variables set were compared.</P>
<P>The procedure of comparison was (1) to trim away 20 outliers from each end of 
the ordered data, (2) to divide all samples into two groups for modeling data 
and test data and (3) to set the cut-off point at 50%. Table V illustrates the 
results of the evaluation of misclassification of bankruptcy and non-bankruptcy 
using the three sets of variables.</P><BR>
<P>Take in Table V</P><BR>
<P>The result of this evaluation proves that the set of variables selected in 
this study has the power of discriminant between bankrupt firms and non-bankrupt 
firms as the misclassification ratio was just 15.96%. Altman [1968] stated that 
the misclassification ratio using the financial ratios he selected one year 
prior to bankruptcy was 4% for the bankrupt group and 21% for the non-bankrupt 
group. However, the analysis of his study was done with just 33 manufacturing 
firms using paired sampling method. Accordingly, his model is not generalizable 
due to the limited size of his sample using paired sampling method. In contrast, 
the variable set selected in this study is more reliable and generalizable 
because the analysis was done with more than 520 firms from many different 
industries including manufacturing, wholesale, retail and service.</P>
<P>Another examination of the discriminant analysis for the mean value of each 
group, bankrupt firms and non-bankrupt firms was also undertaken. The result 
showed that the mean value for the bankrupt group was 98.05% bankrupt 
probability, and the mean value for the non-bankrupt group was 74.24% 
non-bankrupt probability, with a 50% cut-off point. Even though the cut-off 
point was 50%, the type I error is smaller than the type II error, which is 
preferable.</P><BR>
<H4>Evaluation of the influence of industry and size</H4><BR>
<P>It is widely believed that industry and size influence the relationship 
between financial ratios and bankruptcy status. However, Altman [1968] pointed 
out in his study that "it is not completely clear what the relationship is 
between size and ratio" and "matching exact asset size of the two groups seemed 
unnecessary." Therefore, this study hypothesizes that there is no influence 
between the selected variables in this study and industry or size.</P>
<P>Before starting the analysis, all samples were classified by industry and 
size. It must be mentioned here that it is popular to classify firms not by 
asset size but by capital size in Japan. Therefore, they were classified by 
capital size in this study. Table-6 illustrates the result of 
classification.</P><BR>
<P>Take in Table VI</P><BR>
<P>There were three classifications for industry. The Wholesale &amp; Retail 
group consisted of 390 wholesalers and 67 retailers. The others group consisted 
of 50 transportation firms, 127 service industries and 8 firms from other 
industries.</P>
<P>At first, the results of discriminant analysis for each industry group and 
for each capital group were compared, and the mean value of each group was 
analyzed. The results of the analysis are presented in Table VII and Table 
VIII.</P><BR>
<P>Take in Table VII</P><BR>
<P>Take in Table VIII</P><BR>
<P>The mean value for each of the bankrupt groups was more than 92% bankruptcy 
probability. Only the non-bankrupt firms of the other industry group showed 
48.8% non-bankrupt probability. However, the purpose for assessing the firms was 
to predict bankruptcy, and the cost of type I error was more expensive than type 
II error. Therefore, the results of this examination prove that the set of 
variables selected in this study can significantly discriminate the bankrupt 
group independent of industry and size. The reason why the discriminant power of 
the variables set was significant is that these four variables are not 
influenced by industry or size.</P>
<P>In this study, I also attempted to find which variables are influenced by 
industry and size through data mining technique, CART.</P><BR>
<P>Take in Table IX</P><BR>
<P>It is clear that if the variables presented in Table IX were selected for the 
discriminant function, the result of the discriminant analysis would be affected 
by industry and size. On the other hand, the variables selected in this study do 
not include these variables. Therefore I can conclude here that (1) it could not 
be proved that industry and size influence the bankruptcy phenomenon more than 
the four selected variables and (2) the variables which are influenced by 
industry and size are not included among the selected variables of this study. 
Therefore, the variables selected in this study are the universal predictor of 
bankruptcy beyond industry and size.</P><BR>
<H3>MULTIVARIATE DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS MODEL</H3><BR>
<H4>Suitable Model</H4><BR>
<P>I attempt to develop the MDA model using the selected four financial ratios. 
Before developing the model, there is the question of whether a linear model is 
suitable than quadratic or other non-parametric model, normal kernel method 
model. Altman [1968] pointed out in his study that the holdout sample tests 
indicate a clear superiority of linear frameworks. This should also be verified 
using the four financial ratios selected in this study. To verify this, I 
assessed eleven Japanese bankrupt firms which were not included in the original 
sample with linear, quadratic and normal kernel method model using the four 
selected variables (refer to Appendix B). These eleven firms had been listed in 
the Japanese stock market when they went bankrupt during the period between 1986 
- 1996. </P>
<P>The most notable result was the bankruptcy probability of Ga-jo-en Kanko K.K. 
which entered into arrangement procedures in January 1997. The ratio of Retained 
earnings to total assets (X2) of firm was -102.89 one year prior to bankruptcy 
which leaves no doubt regarding its impending insolvency. However, the 
bankruptcy probability indicated by the quadratic model and the normal kernel 
method were 0%. On the other hand, the linear model estimated its bankruptcy 
probability as 99.99%. The results of these three models were completely 
opposite. And it is clear that the linear model is the superior model for 
predicting bankruptcy in Japan.</P><BR>
<H4>Modeling and cut-off point</H4><BR>
<P>Since the accuracy and reliability of the four selected variables have been 
proven, I developed the linear MDA function as follow:</P><BR>
<DIR><B>
<P>Z = 0.014X2 - 0.058X24 - 0.062X36 - 0.003X10 + 0.7416</P></B><BR></DIR>
<P>I analyze the distribution of the Z score for both bankrupt and non-bankrupt 
groups to fix the cut-off point. Classification accuracy of the model will 
change depending on the cut-off point. The balance of type I error cost and type 
II error cost should be considered. Finally, 0.38 was chosen as the Z value that 
best discriminates bankrupt firms and non-bankrupt firms with the lowest 
misclassification cost. Firms with Z values less than 0.38 have a high 
probability (86.14%) of going bankrupt. However, it must not be forgotten that 
the most important point is not the cut-off point, but which variables to use 
for the function. </P><BR>
<H3>CHARACTERISTICS OF BANKRUPTCY IN JAPAN</H3><BR>
<H4>Characteristics of Corporate Behavior</H4><BR>
<P>Having selected the variable set for the prediction model, I can explain 
corporate behavior facing financial distress in Japan as follow;</P><BR>
<DIR><I>
<P>When the cumulative profitability of a firm decreases (the ratio of "X2 
Retained earnings to total assets" decreases), it asks its suppliers to extend 
the date for payment to increase its cash flow (the ratio of "X36 Note payable + 
accounts payable x12 to Sales" is larger). However once it asks its suppliers to 
extend the date for payment, news of bad credit travels through the market. This 
news makes its Bank anxious about its financial condition. Therefore, the Bank 
requests that it pays an additional premium for its loan (the ratio of "X24 
Interest and discount expense to borrowings + corporate bond + note receivable 
discounted" increases). Cash spending increases and the company tries to raise 
funds, increasing liabilities or capital in a year (the ratio of "X10 Current 
gross capital to Previous gross capital -1" increases). </P></I><BR></DIR>
<P>It should be specially noted that among the four variables of the model, 
profitability is not included. The major cause of decreasing cumulative 
profitability (reducing X2) is decreasing profitability. However, even though a 
company's profitability decreases, it can have plenty of cumulative 
profitability and may not go bankrupt.</P><BR>
<H4>Transition of Z score of Japanese Bankrupt Firms </H4><BR>
<P>I examine eleven Japanese listed bankrupt firms to determine the overall 
effectiveness of the model for a longer period of time prior to their 
bankruptcies. Altman [1968] mentioned in his study that after three years prior 
to the bankruptcy, the discriminant model becomes unreliable in its predictive 
ability.</P><BR>
<P>Take in Graph I</P><BR>
<P>Graph I presents the transition of Z score of eleven firms for ten years 
prior to their bankruptcies. It was found that almost all firms had shown worse 
Z score for ten years continuously. I suppose that this is one of the typical 
financial characteristics of Japanese bankrupt firms. Because the majority of 
corporate stockholders of listed firms in Japan are banks and other corporation. 
It is called cross-shareholding, MOCHIAI. It's easier for firms to obtain 
financing from a bank which is a shareholder even though the financial condition 
of the firm were getting worse. Hence, suitable size firms like listed companies 
cannot go bankrupt as soon as they failed in their business. This means if you 
assess firms with the certain model, you can recognize the sing of their 
failures for a considerable time prior to actual bankruptcies.</P><BR><BR>
<H3>CONCLUSIONS</H3><BR>
<P>The model developed in this paper is significantly more accurate in 
predicting bankruptcy for Japan firms than existing models. </P>
<P>One of the notable points is that the variables selected in this study do not 
include profitability and liquidity ratios. It is widely believed that 
profitability and liquidity ratios can predict bankruptcy to a certain extent. 
However, it is proven in this study that these financial ratios could not expose 
the financial distress of Japanese firms. Another noteworthy point is that the 
model proposed in this study is a universal model which is not influenced by 
industry and size. I proved that the model could classify bankrupt firms with 
more than 86.14% accuracy independent of industry and size. I also proved that 
the Japanese bankrupt firms had indicated their worse financial position for a 
considerable time before they actually went bankrupt. </P><BR><BR><BR>
